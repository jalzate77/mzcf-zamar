It is good to praise the Lord
And make music to Your name
O God most high
To proclaim Your love 
And faithfulness
All the day and through the 
Night

Chorus
Lai, lai, lai, lai, lai (7x)

Verse 2
You make me glad 
By Your deeds o Lord
So I sing for joy 
In all Your hands have made
How great are Your works o Lord
Elohim baruch hashem

Verse 3
May I dwell in Your courts o Lord
There to flourish 
Like the trees of Lebanon
Planted in the house of Adonai
There to live forevermore
