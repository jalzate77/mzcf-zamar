I will sing praise to You
For You are King of creation 
I put my trust in You
For You’re the hope of the nations 
 
Chorus
Almighty God
Maker of heaven and earth
Ruler of sky and the sea
And yet You care for me
I give You praise
I give You praise
I lift Your name on high

Verse 2
I will sing praise to You
For You are mighty 
In all Your ways
I put my trust in You
For You’re the guardian 
Of all my days
