I come into Your presence 
To sing a song to You
A song of praise and honor 
For all the things 
You helped us through
You gave a life worth living 
A life in love with You
And now I can’t stop giving 
All my praises back to You

Chorus
You’re the Father of creation
The risen lamb of God
You’re the One who walked away 
From the empty tomb that day
And you’ve set Your people free
With love and liberty
And I will walk with You
Every night and every day
