Lord I come take my life
I offer it to You
As a living sacrifice
By Your grace by Your blood
I come into the holy of holies

Chorus
And all I want to do
Is to dwell in Your presence
And drink from the well
That never runs dry
And all I want to see
Is the light of Your glory
Just one glimpse just one drink
And my soul is satisfied
