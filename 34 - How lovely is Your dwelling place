How lovely is Your dwelling place
Oh, Lord almighty
My soul longs 
And even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied
Within Your presence
I sing beneath 
The shadow of Your wings

Chorus
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere (2x)

Verse 2 
One thing I ask, and I would seek
To see Your beauty 
To find You in 
The place Your glory dwells

Bridge
My heart and flesh cry out
For You the living God
Your spirit’s water for my soul
I’ve tasted and I’ve seen

Come once again to me
I will draw near to You 
I will draw near to You
To You
