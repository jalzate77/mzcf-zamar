Ah, Lord God 
Thou hast made the heavens and 
The earth by thy great power
Ah, Lord God, thou hast made the
Heavens and the earth
By thine outstretched arm
Nothing is too difficult for thee
Nothing is too difficult for thee
O great and mighty God
Great in counsel and mighty in deed
Nothing, nothing 
Absolutely nothing
Nothing is too difficult for thee
