We, Your children pray
Holy spirit rain
Let Your glory come down
Heavenâ€™s river flow
So the world will know
Let Your glory come down
We, Your people
Hunger for Your presence
We are thirsty for the rain
Breathe on us refreshing
Wind of glory
Touch Your people once again

Chorus
Breath of heaven
Fill Your people
Let Your glory come down
