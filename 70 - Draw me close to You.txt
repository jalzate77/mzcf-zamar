Draw me close to You
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear You say 
That I’m Your friend 
You are my desire
Nothing else will do
‘cause nothing else 
Could take Your place
To feel the warmth 
Of Your embrace 
Help me find the way
Bring me back to You

Chorus 
You’re all I want
You’re all I’ve ever needed
You’re all I want
Help me know You are near
