As I behold You
I'm changed from glory to glory
As I acknowledge You 
I'm ushered into Your presence

Chorus 1 
And I cry holy, holy
Holy, holy
Holy is my God
And my King 
 
Verse 2
As I adore You, my faith rises up 
To acknowledge You
And as I seek You
My heart falls prostrate 
Before You

Chorus 2
My soul cries holy, holy
Holy, holy
Holy is my God and my King
