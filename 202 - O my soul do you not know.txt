O my soul do you not know
Have you not heard
It's been told from the beginning
The Lord your God is on your side
O my soul don't be afraid
Hope in the Lord
By His righteousness and power
He will strengthen He will guide

Chorus
I will soar on wings like eagles
Held by the hand of God
I will run and not grow tired
When on His name I call
For the Lord is never weary
His ways are beyond my thoughts
I will trust in Him with all my soul

Coda
And I will rest upon His promise
Patiently I'll wait
