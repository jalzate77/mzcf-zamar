Come, now is the time to worship
Come, now is the time 
To give your heart
Come, just as you are to worship
Come just as you are 
Before your God, come
And one day ev’ry tongue
Will confess You are God
One day ev’ry knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure 
Remains for those who gladly
Choose You now
