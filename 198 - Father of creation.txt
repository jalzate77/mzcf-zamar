Father of creation
Unfold Your sovereign plan
Raise up a chosen generation
That will march through the land
All creation is longing
For Your unveiling of pow'r
Would You release Your anointing
Oh God let this be the hour

Chorus
Let Your glory fall in this room
Let it go forth from here
To the nations
Let Your fragrance rest
In this place
As we gather to seek Your face

Verse 2
Ruler of the nations
The world has yet to see
The full release of Your promise
The church in victory
Turn to us Lord and touch us
Make us strong in Your might
Overcome our weaknesses
That we could stand up and fight

Bridge
Let Your kingdom come echo
Let Your will be done echo
Let us see on earth echo
The glory of Your Son
