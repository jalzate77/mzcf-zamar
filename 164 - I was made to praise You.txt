I was made to praise You
I was made to glorify Your name
In every circumstance 
To find a chance to thank You
I was made to love You
I was made to worship at Your feet
And to obey You Lord
I was made for You

Verse 2
I will always praise You
I will always glorify Your name
In every circumstance
To find a chance to thank You
I will always love You
I will always worship 
At Your feet 
And I'll obey You Lord
I was made for You
