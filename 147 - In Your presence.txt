In Your presence
That’s where I am strong
In Your presence
Oh Lord my God
In Your presence
That’s where I belong
Seeking Your face
Touching Your grace
In the cleft of the rock
In Your presence oh God

Verse 1
I want to go where the rivers
Cannot overflow me
Where my feet are on the rock
I want to hide where the blazing 
Fire cannot burn me
In Your presence o God

Verse 2
I want to hide where the flood
Of evil cannot reach me
Where I’m covered by the blood
I want to be where the schemes
Of darkness cannot touch me
In Your presence o God

Coda
You are my firm foundation
I trust in You all day long
I am Your child and Your servant
And You are my strength
And my song, You’re my song
