I come into Your courts with praise
I bow before Your throne
Your presence gives me peace within
And joy I’ve never known
So I give to You my heart and soul
May it bring You pleasure Lord
There’ no higher call
Than to worship You
For You alone are Lord

Chorus
I worship You, Almighty God
There is none like You
I worship You, o Prince of peace
That is what I want to do
I give You praise
For You are my righteousness
I worship You, Almighty God
There is none like You

Verse 2
Lord I live just to give You praise
Refined enough as gold
Please give to me a heart that’s 
Pure
For I desire to behold 
Your throne o Lord
For You are King
No one else can take Your place
As I close my eyes in Your
Presence o Lord
Let me see You face to face
