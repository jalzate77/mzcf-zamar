I will give thanks to thee 
O Lord, among the people
I will sing praises to thee
Among the nations
For thy steadfast love is great
Is great to the heavens
And thy faithfulness 
Thy faithfulness to the clouds
Be exalted, o God above the heavens
And let thy glory 
Be over all the earth 
Be exalted, o God above the heavens
Let thy glory, let thy glory
Let thy glory 
Be over all the earth
