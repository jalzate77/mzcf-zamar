I have a destiny 
I know I shall fulfill
I have a destiny 
In that city on a hill
I have a destiny 
It's not an empty wish
For I know I was born
For such a time as this

Verse 1 
Long before the ages
You’ve predestined me
To walk in all the works
You have prepared for me
You’ve given me a part
To play in history
To help prepare a bride for eternity

Verse 2
I did not choose
But you have chosen me
And appointed me
For bearing fruit abundantly
I know you will complete
The work began in me
By the power of your spirit
Working mightily
