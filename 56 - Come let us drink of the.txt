Come let us drink of the
Winevats of the spirit
The Lord is pouring out the wine
The anointing is here
And the saints are prophesying
The Lord is pouring out the wine
Hallelujah
He’s pouring out the wine
Hallelujah
It’s the holy ghost divine
The anointing is here
And the saints are prophesying
The Lord is pouring out the wine
