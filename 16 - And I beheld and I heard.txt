And I beheld and I heard 
The voice of many angels
'round about the throne
And the beasts and the elders
And the number of them was ten 
Thousand times ten thousand 
Thousands of thousands
Saying with a loud voice
“blessing and honor
And glory and power
Unto him that sitteth 
Upon the throne
And unto the lamb 
Forever and ever
Worthy is the lamb
That was slain.”
