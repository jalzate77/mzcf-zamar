I want to sing
Till I am lost in Your love
Till am found in Your presence
Worshipping before Your throne
Filled with Your spirit
Entering into Your throne
How precious this moment
Lord I want You to know
It's You 
You who have won my heart
Taking me into Your arms
Comforting me like a friend
Your love 
Surrounded me from the start
I never want to be apart
From You ever again
