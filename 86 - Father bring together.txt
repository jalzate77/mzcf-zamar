Father bring together
The church that bears Your Name
Fill us with the passion
To proclaim that Jesus reigns
Pour oil on our prayers
And let Your spirit come
We'll fight against the darkness
Don't let the flame die down

Chorus
For the church stands before You
In worship prayers burning
Bright against the sky
And Lord we want to burn
Not just a flickering flame
But to be wholly consumed
In Your Name

 (repeat)

But to be wholly consumed
In Your Name
