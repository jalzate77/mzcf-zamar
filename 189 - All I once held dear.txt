All I once held dear
Built my life upon
All this world reveres
And wars to own
All I once held gain
I have counted loss
Spent and worthless now
Compared to this

Chorus
Knowing You Jesus knowing You
There is no greater thing
You're my all You're my best
You're my joy my righteousness
And I love You Lord
And I love You Lord

Verse 2
Now my heart's desire
Is to know You more
To be found in You
And known as Yours
To posses by faith
What I could not earn
All surpassing gifts
Of righteousness

Verse 3
O to know the pow'r
Of Your risen life
And to know You in
Your sufferings
To become like You
In Your death my Lord
So with You to live
And never die
