Say to those
Who are fearful hearted
Do not be afraid
The Lord your God is strong
And with His mighty arms
When you call on His name
He will come and save

Chorus 
He will come and save you
He will come and save you
Say to the weary one
Your God will surely come
He will come and save you

Verse 2
Say to those
Who are broken hearted
Do not lose your faith
The Lord your God is strong
And with His mighty arms
When you call on His name
He will come and save

Coda
He is our refuge
In the day of trouble
He is our shelter
In the time of storm
He is our tower
In the day of sorrow
Our fortress in the time of war

Chorus 2
He will come and save you
He will come and save you
Lift up your eyes to Him
You will arise again
He will come and save you
