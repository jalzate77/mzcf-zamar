You did not wait for me
To draw near to You
But You clothed Yourself 
With frail humanity
You did not wait for me
To cry out to You
But You let me hear Your voice
Calling me

Chorus
And I'm forever grateful to You
I'm forever grateful for the cross
I'm forever grateful to You
That You came 
To seek and save the lost
