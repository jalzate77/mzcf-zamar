Anointed, holy one 
We come before You
Lifting holy hands unto Your name
Bowing down before You
We lift Your name on high
For the glory of the Lord is here
We see Your glory 
Coming down from the Father
We feel the touch 
Of the master's hand
We know a change in us He's making
We will never be the same
Anointed one we bless Your name
We bless Your name
We bless Your name
We bless You Father, Son 
And Holy Ghost
We bless Your name
We bless Your name
We bless You Father, Son
And Holy Ghost
