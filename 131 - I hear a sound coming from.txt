I hear a sound coming from
The mountain
I hear it clearer each day
I hear a sound coming from
The mountain
And it says, “prepare ye the way
Prepare ye the way
Prepare ye the way
Prepare ye the way of the Lord”
 
Verse 2
I see the King standing on 
The mountain
I see Him clearer each day
I see the King standing on 
The mountain
And He says, “prepare ye the way”
