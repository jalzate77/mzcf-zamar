I will never be
The same again
I can never return
I’ve closed the door
I will walk the path
I’ll run the race
And I will never
Be the same again

Chorus
Fall like fire, soak like rain
Flow like mighty water
Again and again
Sweep away the darkness
Burn away the chaff
And let the flame burn
To glorify Your name

Verse 2
There are higher heights
There are deeper seas
Whatever You need to do
Lord, do it in me
The glory of God fills my life
And I will never be the same again
