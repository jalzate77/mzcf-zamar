Fill me with Your holy power
Touch me with Your Holy Spirit now
Use me Lord I'm praying for the hour
When You reveal Your glory
To me Lord

Chorus
Lord I ask for a mighty rushing wind
Lord I seek for renewal deep within
Lord I knock til You open
Heaven's door
And reveal your glory to me Lord

Verse 2
Take me to Your hiding place
Hold me let me feel Your
Warm embrace
I know I will see You face to face
When You reveal Your glory
To me Lord
