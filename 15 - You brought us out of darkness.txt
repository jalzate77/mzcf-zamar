You brought us out of darkness
Into Your marvelous light
From every tribe and every tongue
And nation
You've made a living temple
Out of these living stones
We gather now, o Lord
In worship to Your name

Chorus
And we all cry glory
Yes we all cry glory
And we all cry glory to the King
Glory to the lamb of God

Verse 2
You brought us to the Father
By Your precious blood
Cleansed and made acceptable
In Your sight
And throughout all eternity
With one voice we will sing
The praises of our God and King
