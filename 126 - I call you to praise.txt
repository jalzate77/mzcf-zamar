I call you to praise 
Come and worship
The King in His splendor 
And pow'r
I call you to enter His presence
Come linger in glory this hour
Let us stand in awe 
Through we only see
But a tiny glimpse of His majesty

Chorus
Let us praise Him 
All that is within us
Praise Him and worship 
Our Lord Jesus
All who come before Him 
Stand amazed
I call you now to praise

Verse 2 
I call you to praise now awaken
And set your affections above
Forsake all that keep you 
From praising Him
Delight in His mercy and love
For we've come to know 
But the smallest part
Of the endless love in our 
Father's heart
