I saw heaven opened 
And seated on the throne
Was the ancient and holy one
With angels bowing low
And I heard 
The multitudes of heaven, sing
Worthy is the lamb
To be worshipped and praised
And exalted forever, amen

Chorus
Glory (echo) and honor (echo)
And power (echo) 
And praise to the lamb
Glory (echo) and honor (echo)
And power (echo)
And praise to the lamb of God
Praise to the lamb
And praise to the lamb of God

Verse 2
I saw heaven opened
And seated on a white horse
Was the faithful and holy one
With angels bowing low
Then I heard 
The sound of all creation, sing
Worthy is the lamb
To be worshipped and praised 
And exalted forever, amen
