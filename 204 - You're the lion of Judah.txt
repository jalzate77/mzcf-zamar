You're the lion of Judah
The lamb that was slain
You ascended to heaven
And evermore will reign
At the end of the age
When the earth You reclaim
All the nations will gather
Before You
And the eyes of all men
Will be fixed on the lamb
Who was crucified
For with wisdom mercy and justice
You reign at the Father's side

Chorus
And the angels will cry
Hail the lamb
Who was slain for the world
Rule in power
And the earth will reply
You shall reign
As the King of kings
And the Lord of all lords
There's a sword in our hand
And a shield at our side
There's a fire in our spirit
That cannot be denied
As the Father has told us
For those Christ has died
For the nations that gather
Before You
And the ears of all men
Need to hear of the lamb
Who was crucified
For He descended to hell
Yet was raised up again
To our Father's side
