Great is the Lord 
And most worthy of praise
The city of our God the holy place
The joy of the whole earth

Great is the Lord 
In whom we have the victory
He aids us against the enemy
We bow down on our knee

Chrous
And Lord, we want to lift 
Your name on high 
And Lord, we want to thank You
For the work You've done 
In our lives

And Lord, we trust in your
Unfailing love
For You alone are God eternal
Throughout earth 
And heaven above
