Glory fills this place 
Glory fills this place
As the presence of the Lord comes
Down like gentle falling rain
All the people will rejoice 
And the people lift their voice
Together with angelic choirs
Singing "Holy is the Lord"

Chorus 
And we sing "Holy, holy 
Holy is His name
Hal - le - lu - jah
Let heaven and earth proclaim‚Äù

As we raise our hands and hearts 
In one accord
Singing, "Holy, holy 
Holy is the Lord"
