As we worship You
Let all the world come and see
How the mercy weâ€™ve received 
From You
Can set us free

Verse 2
As we worship You
Let all the joys 
That fill our hearts
Bring a hunger and a hope
To those who strayed so far

Bridge
As we bow in adoration and stand
In reverent awe
Show Your majesty and glory
Let Your anointing fall
As we declare Your name Lord Jesus
As the only name who saves
May the power of Your salvation
Fill each heart we pray

Verse 3
As we worship You
Let all the nations hear our songs
The song of Jesus 
And His blood
That proved His love for all

Verse 4
As we worship You
May all the lost and broken come
May they hear 
Your still small voice 
Call out their name each one
