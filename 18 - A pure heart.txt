A pure heart 
That's what I long for
A heart that follows hard 
After thee

(repeat)

Chorus
A heart that hides Your word
So that sin may not come in
A heart that's undivided
But one You rule and reign
A heart that beats compassion
And pleases You my Lord
A sweet aroma of worship 
That rises to Your throne
