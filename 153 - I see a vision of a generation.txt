I see a vision of a generation 
Coming back to You
I see a vision of a generation 
Getting lost in You 
Hands raised high, with one voice 
They cry to a holy God
I once was blind 
But now I see Your love for me

Verse 2
I see a vision of a generation 
Crying out to You
I see a vision of a generation 
Bowed down before You
On our knees, Lord have mercy
For we have sinned 
Come wash us clean 
We long to see Your glory

Verse 3
I see a vision of a generation 
Sold out for You
I see a vision of a generation 
That would die for You
Refiner’s fire is our hearts desire 
To be like You
So as we decrease 
Lord You will increase, hallelujah

Chorus
So take my life 
I’m giving it all to You
Whatever You want me to do 
I’m gonna follow You
My mind’s made up 
I’m gonna pay the cost 
Just to see salvation of the lost
