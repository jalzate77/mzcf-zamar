Can a nation be changed
Can a nation be saved
Can a nation be turned 
Back to you 

 (repeat)

We're on our knees
We're on our knees again
We're on our knees 
We're on our knees again
Let this nation be changed
Let this nation be saved
Let this nation be turned 
Back to you 

 (repeat)

We're on our knees, 
We're on our knees again
We're on our knees 
We're on our knees again
