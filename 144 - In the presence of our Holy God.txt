In the presence of our Holy God
There's new meaning now to grace
You took all my sins upon Yourself
I can only stand amazed
In the presence of 
Your infinite might
I'm so small so frail and weak
When I see Your pow'r 
And wisdom Lord
I have no words left to speak

Chorus 
And I cry holy, holy, holy God
How awesome is Your name
Holy, holy, holy God
How majestic is Your name
And I am changed
In the presence of the holy God

Verse 2Y
In the presence of Your glory
All my crowns lie in the dust
You are righteous in 
Your judgment Lord
You are faithful, true and just
