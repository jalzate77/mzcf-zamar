You bind the brokenhearted
You heal the wounded soul
Father of all heaven
I give You full control
Come have Your way in me o Lord
Come set my spirit free
Father send revival
And start the work in me

Chorus
Lord I hunger thirst
For Your righteousness
Father come
And fill me once again
Lord I hunger thirst
For Your righteousness
Fill me with Your oil
And Your wine

Verse 2
Fill me with Your spirit I want to see
Your face to live in Your presence
To know Your glory and Your grace
It's not my will but yours I choose
To follow to the end so mold me
Lord and make me
And let a new day begin
