I bow my knee before Your throne
I know my life is not my own
I offer up a song of praise
To bring You pleasure Lord

Verse 2
I seek the giver not the gift
My heartâ€™s desire is to lift You high
Above all earthly kings
To bring You pleasure Lord
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah 
Glory to the King
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah
Glory to the King
