Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the healer set me free
I’m happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing of
When Your love came down

Chorus
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
Oh I feel like dancing
It’s foolishness I know
But when the world has seen the 
Light they will dance with joy
Like we’re dancing now
