As David did in Jehovahâ€™s sight
I will dance with all my might
Before the King of kings
As Miriam did with the tambourine
I will clap my hands and sing
Before the King of kings
As Joshua did at Jericho
We will shout and defeat the foe
Before the King of kings

Chorus
We can come before Him
And worship Him today
We can now adore Him
Jesus made the way
