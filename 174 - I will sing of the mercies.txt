I will sing of the mercies 
Of the Lord forever 
I will sing, I will sing 
I will sing of the mercies 
Of the Lord forever
I will sing of the mercies 
Of the Lord
 
Chorus 
With my mouth, will I make known
Thy faithfulness, thy faithfulness
With my mouth, will I make known
Thy faithfulness to all generations
I will sing of the mercies
Of the Lord forever
I will sing of the mercies
Of the Lord
