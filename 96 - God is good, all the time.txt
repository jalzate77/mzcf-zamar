God is good, all the time
He puts a song of praise
In this heart of mine
God is good, all the time
Through the darkest night
His light will shine, God is good
God is good, all the time

Verse 1 
If you're walking 
Through the valley
And there's shadows all around
Do not fear, He will guide you
He will keep you safe and sound
He has promised to never leave you
Nor forsake you
And His word is true

Verse 2
We were sinners so unworthy
Still for us He came to die
Fill us with His Holy Spirit
Now we can stand and testify
That His love is everlasting
And His mercies they will never end

Coda

Though I may not understand
All the plans You have for me
My life is in Your hands
And through the eyes of faith
I can clearly see
