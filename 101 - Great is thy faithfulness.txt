Great is thy faithfulness
O God my Father
There is no shadow 
Of turning with thee
Thou changest not
Thy compassions they fail not

As thou hast been 
Thou forever shall be
Great is thy faithfulness
Great is thy faithfulness

Morning by morning Lord
New grace I see, all I have needed
Thou hast provided
Great is thy faithfulness
Lord unto me
