Down at Your feet, o Lord
Is the most high place
In Your presence Lord
I seek Your face, I seek Your face
Down at Your feet o Lord
Is the most high place
In Your presence Lord
We seek Your face 
We seek Your face
 
Chorus
There is no higher calling
No greater honor
Than to bow and kneel 
Before Your throne
I'm amazed at Your glory
Embraced by Your mercy
O Lord I live to worship You
