Intro
Lord, open up our eyes
And help us realize
That men are in captivity
For where great sin abound
Much greater grace is found
To help us set the captive free

Refrain
Bind up the enemy
Lord God of victory
I will lay down my life
Singing this battle cry

Chorus
Greater are You who is in me
Greater
Greater Lord Jesus, King of kings
Greater
You set the captive free
Proclaiming liberty 

(intro)

Greater are You, my King

Verse 2
We need Your spirit Lord
Fill us to stand before the enemy
And praise Your name
Come lead us forth, o King
Lord, God of everything
Jesus, the Lord of heaven, reign
