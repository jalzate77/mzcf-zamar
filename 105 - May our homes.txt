May our homes 
Be filled with dancing
May our streets be filled with joy
May injustice bow to Jesus
As the people turn and pray

Chorus
From the mountains to the valleys
Hear our praises rise to You
From the heavens to the nations
Hear the singing fill the air

Verse 2
May a light shine in the darkness
As we walk before the cross
May Your glory 
Fill the whole earth
As the water over the sea

Bridge
Hallelujah, hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelujah
