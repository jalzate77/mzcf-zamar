Jesus, God's righteousness 
Revealed
The Son of man, the Son of God
His kingdom come
Jesus, redemption's sacrifice
Now glorified, now justified
His kingdom come

Chorus 
And this kingdom will know no end
And its glory shall know no bounds
For the majesty and power
Of this kingdom's king has come
And this kingdom's reign
And this kingdom's rule
And this kingdom's power 
And authority
Jesus, God's righteousness 
Revealed 

(repeat introduction)

Verse 2
Jesus, the expression of God's love 
The grace of God, the word of God
Revealed to us
Jesus, God's holiness displayed
Now glorified, now justified
His kingdom come
