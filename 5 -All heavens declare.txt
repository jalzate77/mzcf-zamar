All heavens declare
The glory of the risen Lord
Who can compare
With the beauty of the Lord

Chorus
Forever He will be 
(forever He will be)
The lamb upon the throne 
(the lamb upon the throne)
I gladly bow my knee 
(I gladly bow my knee)
And worship You alone

Verse 2
I will proclaim
The glory of the risen Lord
Who once was slain 
To reconcile man to God
