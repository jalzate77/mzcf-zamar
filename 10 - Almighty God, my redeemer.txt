Almighty God, my redeemer
My hiding place, my safe refuge
No other name but Jesus
No pow’r can stand against You

Verse 2
My feet are planted on this rock
And I will not be shaken
My hope, it comes from You alone
My Lord and my salvation

Chorus1
Your praise is always on my lips
Your word is living in my heart
And I will praise You 
With a new song
My soul will bless You lord

Chorus2
You fill my life with greater joy
Yes, I delight myself in You
And I will praise You 
With a new song 
My soul will bless You Lord

Bridge
When I am weak 
You make me strong
When I’m poor, I know I’m rich
For in the power of Your name
All things are possible (4x)
