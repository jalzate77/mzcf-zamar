As I reach my hands 
Unto Your throne
I am longing for Your presence.
And my heart is fixed 
And my eyes are set
On the one who reigns in Zion
I'll proclaim You are my master
And I'll sing You are my King
Blessed one who draws me closer
I am running after thee

Chorus
I'm running after thee
(running after thee)
I'm running after thee, 
After thee, after thee
I'm running after thee
(running after thee)
I am running after thee
