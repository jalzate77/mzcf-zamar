You are beautiful
Beyond description
Too marvelous for words
Too wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard
Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom
Who can fathom 
The depths of Your love
You are beautiful 
Beyond description 
Majesty enthroned above

Chorus 
And I stand, I stand in awe of You
I stand, I stand in awe of You
Holy God to whom all praise is due
I stand in awe of You
