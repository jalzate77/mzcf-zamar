We will give ourselves no rest
Till Your kingdom comes on earth
You've positioned watchmen
On the walls
Now our prayers
Will flow like tears

For You've shared Your heart with us
God of heaven
On our knees we fall

Pre-Chorus
Come down in power
Reveal Your heart again
Come hear our cries
The tears that plead for rain

Chorus
We're knocking
Knocking on the door of heaven
We're crying
Crying for this generation
We're praying for Your name
To be known in all the earth
We're watching
Watching on the walls to see You
We're looking
Looking for a time of breakthrough
We're praying for Your word
To bear fruit
In all of the earth
In all of the earth
