He is Jehovah Mighty God
He will stand 
Even in the dark of night
He will not be dethroned
By any whim of man
He's your strength
Thru your sorrow He will stand

Chorus
Jesus, Jesus, Mighty God is He 
He's wonderful, counselor
Everlasting King
Jesus, Jesus
It's to You we long to sing
Jesus, Jesus
Hide me in Your wings

Verse 2
He is Jehovah Mighty God
When you weep He will weep with you
He will not chasten 
In the sorrow of your heart
But with Great care 
He'll come wipe away
Your tears
