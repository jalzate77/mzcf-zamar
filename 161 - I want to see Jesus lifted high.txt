I want to see Jesus lifted high
A banner that flies 
Across the land
That all men may see 
And know the truth
That He is the way to heaven
I want to see, I want to see
I want to see Jesus lifted high

(repeat)

Step by step we're moving forward
Little by little taking ground
Every step a powerful weapon
Strongholds come, tumbling down
And down and down and down
