Be still & know that I am God
I will be glorified and praised 
In all the earth 
For my great name 
I will be found
And can never be resisted, 
Never be undone
Iâ€™m never lacking power 
To glorify my Son
The gates of hell are falling 
And the church is coming forth
My name will be exalted 
In the earth

Verse 2
Be still & know that I am God
I have poured out My Holy Spirit
Like a flood 
The land that cries 
For holy rain
Shall be inheriting her promises 
 
And dancing like a child 
A holy typhoon deluge  
Shall bless the barren heights 
And those who sat in silence
Shall speak up and be heard
My name will be exalted 
In the earth

Verse 3
Be still & know that I am God
My son has asked me for
The nations of the world
His sprinkled blood 
Has made a way
For all the multitudes 
Of India and Africa to come
The Middle East shall find its peace 
Through Jesus Christ My son
From London down to Cape Town
From L.A. To Beijing
My Son shall reign
The undisputed King
