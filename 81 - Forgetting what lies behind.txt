Forgetting what lies behind
Setting our hearts on the prize
Always keeping our eyes 
On our Lord Jesus
We're running the race to win
All the way to the end 
Laying down every sin 
That would seek to hinder us

Chorus 
And we'll be faithful
To our calling
For You are able 
To keep us from falling
For in Your promise
We will trust
You'll be faithful to finish 
The work You began in us
