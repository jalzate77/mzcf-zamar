There is a longing only You can fill
A raging tempest only You can still
My soul is thirsting Lord
To know You as I’m known
Drink from the river
That flows before Your throne

Chorus
Take me deeper
Deeper in love with You
Jesus hold me close
In Your embrace
Take me deeper
Deeper than I’ve ever been before
I just want to love You
More and more
How I long to be deeper in love

Verse 2
Sunrise to sunrise
I will seek Your face
Drawn by Your spirit
To the promise of Your grace
My heart is found in You
A hope that will abide
Here in Your presence
Forever satisfied
