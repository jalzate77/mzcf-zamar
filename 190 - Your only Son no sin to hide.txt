Your only Son no sin to hide
But You have sent Him
From Your side
To walk upon this guilty sod
And to become the lamb of God

Verse 2
Your gift of love they crucified
They laughed and scorned Him
As He died
The humble King
They named a fraud
And sacrificed the lamb of God

Chorus
O lamb of God sweet lamb of God
I love the holy lamb of God
O wash me in Your precious blood
My Jesus Christ the lamb of God

Verse 3
I was so lost I should have died
But You have brought me
To Your side
To be led by Your staff and rod
And to be called a lamb of God

(Repeat chorus except the last line)

Till I am just a lamb of God
