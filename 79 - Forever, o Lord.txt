Forever, o Lord
Your word is settled in heaven
Your faithfulness Lord
Continues to all generations
Your covenant magnified
Exalted along with Your 
Holy name
Rejoicing in promises
I meditate on all 
Your righteous ways 
I lift up my hands
And praise the power 
Of Your command
Forever, o Lord
Your word shall stand
Forever, o Lord
Your word shall stand
