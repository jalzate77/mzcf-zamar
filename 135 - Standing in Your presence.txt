Standing in Your presence
Lord my heart and life 
Are changed
Just to love You and to live to
See Your beauty and Your grace

Chorus
Heaven and earth 
Cry out Your name
Nations rise up and see Your face
And Your kingdom is established
As I live to know You more
 
Now I will never be the same
Spirit of God 
My life You’ve changed.
And I’ll forever sing Your praise
I live to know You Lord 
I live to know You Lord

Verse 2
You’ve called me, I will follow
Your will for me I’m sure
Let Your heart beat 
Be my heart’s cry
Let me live to serve Your call
