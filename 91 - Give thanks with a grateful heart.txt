Give thanks with a grateful heart
Give thanks to the Holy One
Give thanks because He's given 
Jesus Christ His Son

Give thanks with a grateful heart
Give thanks to the Holy One
Give thanks because He's given
Jesus Christ His Son

And now, let the weak say 
I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done
For us, give thanks
