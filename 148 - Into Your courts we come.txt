Into Your courts we come
We lift our hands, we long to be 
Near to the throne of Your glory 
As we draw near to You 
Know that weâ€™re here
To do Your will, o God how we long
To be near to You

Chorus
May our prayers be like incense
Rising up to Your throne
May our songs be a fragrance
Unto You 
May our lives be a pleasing 
Offering in all that we do
O God how we long to be near 
To You
