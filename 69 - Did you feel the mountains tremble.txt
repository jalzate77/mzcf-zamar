Did you feel the mountains tremble? 
Did you hear the oceans roar?
When the people rose to sing of
Jesus Christ the risen one
Did you feel the people tremble?
Did you hear the singers roar
When the lost began to sing of 
Jesus Christ the risen one
And we can see that God 
You’re moving
A mighty river through the nations
And young and old 
Will turn to Jesus
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Prepare the way of the risen Lord

Chorus
Open up the doors, let the music play
Let the streets resound with 
Singing 
Songs that bring your hope
Songs that bring your joy
Dancers who dance upon injustice
Do you feel the darkness tremble?
When the saints join in one song?
And all the streams flow 
As one river 
To wash away our brokenness
And we can see that God 
You’re moving
A time of jubillee is coming
When young and old 
Will turn to Jesus
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Prepare the way of the risen Lord
