We invite you, Lord 
Into this temple
As we gather here 
To magnify Your name
You inhabit the praises 
Of Your people
So be welcomed as our hearts 
Are joined in praise

Chorus
Come be glorified, o Lord
Come be glorified
 A a+/db 
As Your praise now fills 
This temple, and as we 
Raise Your name on high
May Your presence fall upon Your 
People, come Lord 
Be glorified
