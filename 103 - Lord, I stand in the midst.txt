Lord, I stand in the midst
Of a multitude 
Of those from every tribe 
And tongue
We are Your people
Redeemed by Your blood
Rescued from death by Your love
There are no words 
Good enough to thank You
There are no words 
To express my praise
But I will lift up my voice
And sing from my heart
With all my strength

Chorus
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah to the Lamb
Hallelujah, hallelujah
By the blood of Christ we stand
Every tongue, every tribe
Every people, every land
Giving glory, giving honor
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God

Verse 2
Lord, we stand by grace 
In Your presence
Cleansed by the blood of the Lamb
We are Your children 
Called by Your name 
Humbly we bow and pray 
Release Your power to work in us 
And through us 
'til we are changed 
To be more like You
Then all the nations will see
Your glory revealed 
And worship You

Coda
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
That You are Lord of all

(repeat chorus except the last line)
 
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God
Jesus Christ, Lamb of God
