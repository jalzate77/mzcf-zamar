When the music fades 
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring 
Something that’s of worth
That will bless Your heart
I’ll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You’re looking into my heart

Chorus
I’m coming back 
To the heart of worship
And it’s all about You
All about You, Jesus
I’m sorry Lord 
For the thing I’ve made it
When it’s all about You
All about You, Jesus

Verse 2
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much You deserve
Though I’m weak and poor 
Every single breath
